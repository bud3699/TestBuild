#Scripts

This is a collection of Powershell scripts, written during the whole driver development. There haven't been a focus on keeping the scripts "up to date" all the time. Which means changes that might have occurred in the modules that these scripts depend upon, haven't been corrected either. 

This is more ment as a framework for "tinkers" to make use of Powershell to change settings on the fly. 

To use these, you should be at least be comfortable with Powershell and understand Admin privilegiets, risk/reward.

PR's are welcome for improvements or other/more functions.
